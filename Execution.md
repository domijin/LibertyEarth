## Initial Design of Execution

A toy model to crowd-form a collaborative team before tools and methodologies are developed.

### A spice about the economic scene

This is not my first priority to solve but it is important. This is only a spice about how I think might be the best interest to align the community to grow as individuals grow. Again it's a toy model open to improve. (All numbers are not justified yet.)

The added new valuation of the community will be 80% distributed to shareholders based on fulfillment to the approved request for proposal. No dilution for earned shares and the maximum dividend of any capital will be from the rest 20%. Shares can be cashed at the market value as paychecks or fund mature with a calculated delay based on the amount. 

All terms will be legislated through liquid democracy when the blockchain system is implemented. Otherwise, a selected jury will be temporary act as the trustee. 


What's special?

- Institutional design to eliminate manager role for equality, while remaining the efficiency. 
- The community grows as each individual grows. The best way to grow is keeping everyone on the same page, and involved in decision making.
- Distribution of shares will be reflected by the amount of contribution and decisions will be justified by the amount of shares. 
- Capital dividend is capped unless capital becomes part of the community and the contribution is recognized by community members.
- Universal basic income will give new members a piece of mind to learn and catch up.


Example of potential problems to inspire more challenging questions but also constructive answers.

- How to avoid bank run when the valuation of the community drops?
    - Vesting period of the new earned shares based on the amount.
